# PyVaggio - a computational exploration into the paintings of Michelangelo Caravaggio

## *A work very much in progress*

*What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting" - Andr√© Berne-Joffroy*

## Goal
- **Goal 1:** can a binary classifier to learn to distinguish the paintings of Caravaggio from those of his close followers?
    - motivated by the misattribution of  *The Taking of Christ* (see [1]) and a 'new' Caravaggio painting found in 2016 ([2])

## Data Gathering

### Positive Examples 
All paintings from Caravaggio used as positive training examples (see [3]), totaling about 90 works


### Negative Examples 

Three general categories (1) Caravaggio's predecessors and painters with influence on Caravaggio, 
(2) Caravaggio's followers, and (3) paintings in similar medium to Caravaggio, such as Italian Renaissance oil painting, 
but are not particularly related to his art 

#### (1) Influence on Caravaggio 

Titian, Giorgione, Carracci, and Italian Mannerism

#### (2) Caravaggisti 
Falls into five categories, by region *Italian*, *Dutch*, *Flemish*, *French* and *Spanish*.  
Hypothesis is that this will be the hardest case, since art historians have confused his followers paintings
with Caravaggio's, such as *The Taking of Christ* ([1])
