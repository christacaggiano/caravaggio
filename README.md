# PyVaggio - a computational exploration into the paintings of Michelangelo Caravaggio

## *A work very much in progress*

**What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting" - Andr√© Berne-Joffroy**

## Goal
- *Goal 1:* can a binary classifier to learn to distinguish the paintings of Caravaggio from those of his close followers?
    - motivated by the misattribution of  *The Taking of Christ* (see [1]) and a 'new' Caravaggio painting found in 2016 ([2])

### Data Gathering

- *Positive cases:* All paintings from Caravaggio used as positive training examples (see [3]), totaling about 90 works
- *Negative cases:*  
    - The Caravaggisti - hardest case. Falls into four schools- *Italian*, *Dutch*, *Flemish*, *French* and *Spanish*.
    Groups most likely to be mis-attributed as Caravaggio 
    - Caravaggio's inspiration and peers- painters that directly influenced Caravaggio's style or were contemporaries of Caravaggio. Examples such as Titian, Giorgione, Carracci, and Italian Mannerism
    - General Renaissance oil painting -
